                <h2>Ionic & Covalent Bonds</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many types of chemical bonds that hold molecules together,
                    the two most basic types of bonds are ionic and covalent. In an
                    ionic bond is a bond held together by differences in charge between
                    atoms. In a covalent bond is a bond held together by sharing an
                    electron between atoms.
                </p>
                <h4>Ionic Bonds</h4>
                <p>
                    Ionic bonds form from atoms exchanging electrons in order to have a full shell. Ionic bonds form
                    between metals and nonmetals because metals typically lack electron in their
                    <span class="tooltip">
                        valence shell
                        <span class="tooltipText">
                            The outer most shell of an atom.
                        </span>
                    </span>
                    while nonmetals, especially those on the far right of the periodic table have close to 8 electrons
                    in their valence shell.
                </p>

                <h4>Covalent Bonds</h4>
                <p>
                    Covalent bonds typically form from two atoms that are close to each
                    other on the periodic table. Also, atoms with similar
                    <span class="tooltip">
                        electronegativity
                        <span class="tooltipText">
                            The attraction electrons have to a given atom.
                        </span>
                    </span>
                    are more likely to form covalent bonds. This is because electrons are equally attracted to both of
                    them, so electrons are shared to create a full valence shell.
                </p>
                <h4>Naming</h4>
                <p>
                    Ionic:
                <ul>
                    <li>The cation is written first and the anion second.</li>
                    <li>The charges of the ions must cancel out, if the absolute value of one ion is not equal to
                        another use subscripts to balance them.</li>
                    <li>Examples
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                \(\ce{Na^+ + Cl^- -> NaCl}\)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                \(\ce{Ca^2+ + 2Cl^- -> CaCl_2}\)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                \(\ce{3Mg^2+ + N_2^3- -> Mg_3N_2}\)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <!-- The names of ionic compounds relies on inference based on the charge of the elements, however some
                    elements can have multiple charges, in this case roman numerals are used to denote the charge of the
                    cation. A 'formula' for naming binary ionic compounds is below. -->

                    Covalent:
                <ul>
                    <li>Covalent compounds are named using prefixes that indicate how many of the substance there are.
                    </li>
                    <li>If there is only one of the first substance no prefix is used. The first material has the full
                        name while the second material is the root, ending in -ide.</li>
                    <li>The prefixes listed respectively from one to ten are: mono, di, tri, tetra, penta, hexa, hepta,
                        octa, nona, and deca.</li>
