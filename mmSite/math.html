                <h2>Polynomials</h2>
                <p>A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables, coefficients, and the operations of addition,
                    subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentiation of variables. An example of a
                    polynomial is \(x^2 − 4x + 7\).
                    A term is a section of a polynomial consisting only of a single coefficient, variable, and exponent.
                    In the above example, \(x^2 − 4x + 7\), the terms are \(x^2\), \(-4x\), and \(7\). A polynomial with
                    only one term is called a monomial, polynomials with two and three terms are called binomials and
                    trinomials respectively.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The degree of a term is the power that it's variable is raised to, and the
                    degree of an entire polynomial is the degree of it's highest degree term. The roots of a polynomial
                    are the input values that yield an output of zero, these roots can be imaginary.
                </p>
                <h4>Factorization</h4>
                <p>All polynomials can be written as a factored form in which the polynomial is written as the product
                    of irreducible polynomials. To factor a polynomial we find the greatest common factor of all the
                    coefficients, and then notate it as the factor times the polynomial divided by that factor. As an
                    example, let us factor the polynomial \(6x^2 + 12x - 9\). \(3\) is the greatest factor that the
                    coefficients:
                    \(6\), \(12\), and \(9\) share. Knowing this we can rewrite the polynomial as \(3(2x^2 + 6x - 3)\).
                    It should also be noted that you can factor out variables as well. As a quick example: \(4x^3 + 8x\)
                    factors to \(4x(x^2 + 2)\).
                <h4>Quadratics</h4>
                <p>A quadratic is a 2nd degree polynomial. The standard quadratic form is \(ax^2 + bx + c\). We can find
                    the roots of a quadratic using the quadratic formula, \(\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\). When \(a =
                    1\), or is factored out the two roots of a polynomial, \(r_1\) and \(r_2\), satisfy the

                <h4>Exponential Functions</h4>
                <p>
                    An exponential function is a function that takes the general form \(f(x) = ab^x\). Exponential
                    function are used to model exponential growth, which is when the output values changes by the same
                    ratio between every equal distant set of input points.

                <h2>Logarithms</h2>
                <p>
                    A logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. If \(x^n = m\), then \(\log_x(m)=n\). This
                    identity allows us to solve both exponential, and logarithmic problems. For example, if it's given
                    that \(2^{3x} = 64\), the value of \(3x\) can be calculated as \(\log_2(64) = 6\), then divide by
                    three to get the value of \(x\) as two.
