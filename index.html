    Hi! I only really have this domain for emails and to compensate for dynamic ips, so I don't have anything much here atm. Nonetheless, feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/claytongearhart">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clayton-gearhart-051b7a250/">LinkedIn</a> (pretty inactive).

    I do have one thought to put here. "Good design is as little design as possible." (Dieter Rams) I didn't spend more than 15mins making this website, yet it's still faster, more responsive, and more accessible than anything I've made using React or whatever the newest JS framework is.    </div>
