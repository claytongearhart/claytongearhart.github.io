            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>ASFA represents America’s entire synthetic fuel industry. From up-stream production to downstream consumer facing businesses. Our constituent members provide more than 5 million American jobs. ASFA’s mission is to promote the use of synthetic fuels, aiding energy security and the life of Americans by keeping energy production local. We speak for the synfuel industry to the Public, Congress, state governments, and the media. We participate in coalitions and negotiate with regulatory industries to help advance the adaptation of synfuels. All segments of the synfuel industry are unified in our commitment to meet climate goals while meeting the global demand for affordable energy and petrochemicals.</p>
